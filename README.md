## JSON.date
As some background context, I needed a short URL for testing purposes and while browsing domains came across this one. The original testing was for a different project, however this gave me the idea of having a simple service to return date and time objects in the JSON format.

Written in Flask and hosted with [fly.io](https://fly.io) it's a lightweight and simple site I'm using to learn and improve my knowledge on Flask as well as APIs.

## TODO
Some things I'd like to accomplish:

- [x] Expand on data returned
- [x] Fix the order of the data returned
- [x] Fix accepting timezone via argument
- [ ] Create documentation for the tool
- [ ] Consider rate limiting
